# Twitter-Java-Spy
Project which was part of school assigment for Software Development and Projects modules. Aim to analyze twitter using Twitter API and display data in graph form using JavaFX
Application were searching in Twitter for given hashtag and fetch result to present graph based on this hashtag it also could provide text of this tweet etc. 
It use to limit twitter API limitations so its not wise to fetch to much tweet using it but even so the application has sleep option to wait for limit to reset.
